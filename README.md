# Bacteria_Biodiverisy

**Background**

Research project to analyze bacterial species found in human navals. To date, synthetic beef has been synthesized by labs using algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. Now, a lab has partnerned with Improbable Beef, a food startup looking to find bacteria that can synthesize proteins that tastes like beef. The lab has hypotesized that these bacteria can potentially be found in the human navel. They proceed to conduct a study on a group of people across the country, taking bacterial samples from their naval. The results of each particpant are posted on a public website, where both the lab researchers and participants can see the anonymized results.

**Resources Used**

* JSON file with raw data
* D3.json
* Plotly.js
* Functional JavaScript

**Results**

The results are posted to a public website that works as an interactive dashbaord with visualizations that summarize the bacterial cultures found in each participant.
